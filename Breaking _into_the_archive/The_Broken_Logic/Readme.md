The trail didn’t end where Specter pointed it.
It only deepened.
What waited on the  other side was an archive with not a single answer 
but fragments.
Three pieces.
Separate. Independent.
Each one looked complete on its own.
Each one ran.
Each one spoke.
But none of them told the whole truth.
ByteBandits noticed the pattern almost immediately.
The outputs didn’t align.
The results felt incomplete.
Like Specter had split a message across multiple layers 
not to hide it,
but to make sure it couldn’t be understood in one pass.
The logic was there.
But twisted.
Folded in on itself.
What looked simple on the surface
behaved differently underneath.
As if the real meaning lived behind the  execution.

Only by pulling it apart,
reconstructing intent,
and stitching the fragments back together…
does the path reappear.
And when the pieces finally align,
they don’t reveal an answer.
They reveal another destination. 🚀
