# Stage 6 — The Silent Channel 🌐
The destination led somewhere colder.
No interface.No names.
No files to browse..
Just a capture.
A frozen slice of communication ,
packets suspended in time,
as if someone had pulled the plug mid-transmission.

ByteBandits 💀  stared at the traffic.
Nothing obvious surfaced.
No readable messages.
No direct links.
Only fragments moving through a channel
that no longer exists.
The data looked meaningless at first.
Scattered. Broken ⛓️‍💥 
Out of context.
But Dark Army never sent chaos.
Every signal had purpose.
Every transmission had structure.
What Specter left here wasn’t a message -
it was a conversation .

And the truth isn’t written in any single piece.
It lives in how the pieces relate. 
How they flow.
How the signal 📡 was meant to travel.

Reconstruct the communication,
and the silence begins to speak.
Not with words.
But with a Final destination .
One last place Specter tried to reach
before the channel went dark.
