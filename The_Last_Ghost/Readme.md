Stage 7 -- The Last Ghost 👁️ 

This was it.
The final destination Specter ever touched. 
No folders.
No trails beyond this point.
Just few files.
Cold. Silent. Unlabeled.
Not a message.Not a document.
Something that _runs_ .
ByteBandits hesitated.
Specter had spent the entire trail hiding behind layers -
images, signals, traces, fragments.
But this time, there was nothing to peel away.
The file didn’t show its secrets.
It executed them.
What it revealed on the surface
wasn’t the truth -
just the echo of it.

The real story lives underneath.
In the instructions it follows.
In the decisions it makes.
In the paths it never takes.

This isn’t about running the program.
It’s about understanding it.🔍
Because somewhere inside this last ghost…
buried beneath layers of ⚙️ logic and illusion…
is the *message* .
The truth Specter tried to leak.
The end of the transmission.
And the end of the hunt ⚔️.
