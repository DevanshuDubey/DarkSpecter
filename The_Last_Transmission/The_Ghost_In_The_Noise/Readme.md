The image wasn’t the only thing Specter tried to send.
While forensic analysts were tearing apart the corrupted data stream,
they noticed something buried deeper in the signal.
Not text. Not images. " *Sound* ".

A thin, distorted audio track was embedded inside the transmission 
so faint it was almost lost beneath the static.
At first, it sounds like nothing more than noise.
Short clicks followed by longer ones.
Strange beeps that don’t follow any natural rhythm.
But ByteBandits knows better. Dark Army never wastes bandwidth.
If Specter hid sound inside the transmission, it wasn’t for atmosphere.

Some pulses are brief. Some linger. separated by deliberate gaps.
Like someone knocking…but in a language only a machine would hear.

it wasn’t meant to be listened to - it was meant to be interpreted.
Repeating patterns. Shorts and longs. Silence used as carefully as sound.

whatever waits at the end of it is far too important to ignore.
